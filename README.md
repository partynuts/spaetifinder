# spaetifinder

This project is a mobile web app that shows you all Spätis/open late Kiosks near you in Berlin, depending on your location. 
It uses the Google Maps API and a Späti-database API. You can either allow to be located or type in an address and it will show all spätis within a radius of
600 meters. Zooming and dragging the map will show more or less results. Clicking on the Späti will give you information about the products, business hours and 
directions to that späti.

Not yet possible but planned is the possibility to add new Spätis that are not on the map yet.
